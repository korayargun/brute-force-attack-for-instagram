You should create a wordlist in "txt" format. Then rename it "wordlist".
Also you should install python's selenium library.

For Windows and MacOS use this commands :

  pip3 install selenium

For Linux use this commands :

  sudo pip3 install selenium

In the app you will enter instagram account's username.
Then it will begin to try passwords in your wordlist.

I hope I was help you. Good Luck!

My wordlist generator will come as soon as possible!
